# PhotoEditorProject
Basic photo editor that allows to perform the following operations on a given image:
1. Filtering
2. Drawing
3. Blending
Ghostscript is required for the 'save' function to work successfully, since the code deals with postscript files. However, all of the functions with the exeption of 'save' work perfectly fine without Ghostscript.
